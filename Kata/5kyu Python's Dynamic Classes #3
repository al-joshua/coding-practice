"""So - shouted boss, heading to Tim's office - we have new contract!.
- What is it? - ask Tim.
- Do not know, frankly, it's secret! It's from army! - boss was obviously excited.
- So how are we supposed to write anything, if it is so big secret?
- And that's the point! We won't know it, but we will write it. We have to prepare mechanism to create dynamic
classes with properties and methods given as a parameters. - explained boss.
- I don't think that's, umm... But would we at least know names of these properties and methods, right?
- No. Remember that it's secret, so we'll not know anything!
- Nah, it's impossible! - cried Tim.

Then Tims went to find you - his almighty guru - and ask to help him. You reminded him: - It's Python, here everything
is possible! Ok, let's see....

So, in that Kata, your task is to finish function create_class that will get some class name and secret dictionary and
make class of it. That dictionary will be delivered by function army_get_secret_from_file() which is already completed.
Tim also asked you to make sure that if class name is empty, it should be None as result, and to make possible to call
function without second parameter. Returned object should be the new-style class, which has only to inherit the base
methods of the class object."""


def create_class(class_name, secrets={}):
    if class_name:
        return type(class_name, (), secrets)
